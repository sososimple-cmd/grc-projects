# 🔐 Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) Projects

Welcome to my GRC project portfolio!  
This space highlights real-world cybersecurity governance and risk initiatives I’ve completed to better understand how businesses secure data, ensure compliance, and manage organizational risk.

These projects demonstrate practical applications of industry frameworks like:

- 🛡️ NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
- 🧾 ISO/IEC 27701 (Privacy Information Management)
- 📊 Security & Privacy Risk Matrices
